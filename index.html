        <h2 class="grid-item__opinion">
          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
        </h2>
        <p class="grid-item__experience">
          "Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code. I needed some structure of professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. He encouraged me to enroll a former student of his who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands on and I never had to wait long for help. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial ever could. In fact, I have often referred to him during interviews as an example of my development experience, for me he is an example to follow both personally and professionally. It certainly helped me get a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommendable!"

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.
        </h2>
        <p class="grid-item__experience">
          "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."
